Train the Model\n\nNow that we've created the model we need to configure it for training.\n\n#### Configure model training\n\n\nLet's first define the terms _loss function_ and _accuracy metric_.\n\nA loss function is used to optimize a machine learning algorithm. The loss is calculated on training and validation and its interpretation is based on how well the model is doing in these two sets. It is the sum of errors made for each example in training or validation sets. Loss value implies how poorly or well a model behaves after each iteration of optimization. \n\nIn this notebook we choose [categorial_crossentropy](https://gombru.github.io/2018/05/23/cross_entropy_loss/) as loss function, which is best suited for multi-class classification. \n\nAn accuracy metric is used to measure the algorithm’s performance in an interpretable way. Accuracy of a model is usually determined after the model parameters and is calculated in the form of a percentage. It is the measure of how accurate your model's prediction is compared to the true data. <br>\n\nWhile there are many optimizers for the gradient descent and most of them would do the job, we choose the [Adam algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980) as it appears to be the most common across common deep learning implementations for such tasks. During training and testing the _accuracy_ metrics will be evaluated. \n\nFor information about additional configuration options and details refer to the [`model.compile()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model#compile) documentation."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"code","source":"model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy',\n              optimizer='adam',\n              metrics=['accuracy'])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Train the model\n\nWe train the model by calling [`model.fit()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model#fit).

For image data, this can be creating more data artificially by doing “flips”, “rotations”, playing with color, brightness, etc in order to create more and “more difficult to classify” training examples in order to allow the model to learn more with the same amount of actual data.\n\n#### Next steps\n\n- Close this notebook.\n\n\n<a id=\"authors\"></a> \n### Authors\n\nThis notebook was created by the [Center for Open-Source Data & AI Technologies](http://codait.org).\n<br><br>\n\nCopyright © 2019 IBM.
